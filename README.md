# Yolo_Pose
## Overview
Yolo_Pose is a project that leverages the ONNX runtime inference engine for real-time pedestrian detection and pose estimation in videos. While Ultralytics provides well-encapsulated APIs, it lacks support for model quantization, which is crucial for optimizing performance on edge devices. This repository aims to fill that gap by offering additional utilities and scripts tailored for quantization and deployment.
